v1 node/ express start file

the project uses 1 schema "userSchema"

It has a couple of useful middleware functions : -ErrorsHandler, authentication, notFound

It uses custom error classes to handle different error cases.

It has 3 routes : register user, login, fetch users

I  will build v2 of this repo which will handle authentication workflow in a more robust way.
